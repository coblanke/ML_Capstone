# Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project
This repository shows the work that I have done during my capstone project of the EPFL Extension School Applied Data Science: Machine Learning program.

It starts with my *project proposal*, then demonstrates what I have leant in *Exploratory Data Analysis* and *Machine Learning*, and finally summarizes the most important results in a *project defence*.
